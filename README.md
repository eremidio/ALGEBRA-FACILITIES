# ALGEBRA FACILITIES

THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN MANY MATHEMATICAL ALGORTITHMS CONCERNING ALGEBRA E LINEAR ALGEBRA. ALGORITHMS IN THESE AREAS ARE ESSENTIAL IN SOME OTHER AREAS IN MATHEMATICS LIKE NUMBER THEORY, COMBINATORICS AND PROBRABILTY WHERE OFTEN WE USE SOME ALGEBRAIC REPRESENTATIONS AND BASIC ALGORITHMS TO IMPLEMENT MORE COMPLEX ALGORITHMS.

THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES OR A COMPLETE ALGEBRAIC SYSTEM PER SI, BUT ONLY PROVIDES SOME SNIPPETS OF CODE TO HANDLE USEFUL ALGEBRAIC TOPICS LIKE POLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, DETERMINANTS AND SO ON. IT WILL UPDATED WHERE THEY APPEAR IN OTHER COMPLEX ALGORITHMS. 

FOR EXAMPLE: BASIC ALGEBRA LINEAR, PARTICULARLY MATRICES, IS AN ESSENTIAL SUBJECT IN MORE COMPLEX ALGORITHMS IN NUMBER THEORY (FOR INSTANCE MODERN FACTORING METHODS LIKE THE QUADRATIC SIEVE OR NUMBER FIELD SIEVE) AND THEORY OF PROBABILITY (MARKOV CHAINS, MARTINGALE AND SO ON).

ANY CONTRIBUTION OR SUGGESTION IS ENTIRELY WELLCOME.
