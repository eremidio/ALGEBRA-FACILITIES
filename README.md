# ALGEBRA FACILITIES

THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN MANY MATHEMATICAL ALGORITHMS CONCERNING ALGEBRA, SPECIALLY LINEAR ALGEBRA. ALGORITHMS IN THE AREA ARE ESSENTIAL IN SOME OTHER MATHEMATICAL TOPICS LIKE NUMBER THEORY, COMBINATORICS AND PROBABILITY THEORY WHERE OFTEN WE USE SOME ALGEBRAIC REPRESENTATIONS TO IMPLEMENT HIGHLY COMPLEX ALGORITHMS OR MATHEMATICAL STRUCTURES.

FOR EXAMPLE: BASIC LINEAR ALGEBRA, PARTICULARLY MATRICES, IS AN ESSENTIAL SUBJECT IN MORE COMPLEX ALGORITHMS IN NUMBER THEORY (FOR INSTANCE MODERN FACTORING METHODS LIKE THE QUADRATIC SIEVE OR NUMBER FIELD SIEVE), COMBINATORICS (COMPUTATION OF INTEGER SEQUENCES) AND THEORY OF PROBABILITY (MARKOV CHAINS, MARTINGALES AND SO ON). POLYNOMIALS ARE USEFUL TO COMPUTE INTEGER SEQUENCES IN COMBINATORICS AND TO COMPUTE ARITHMETICAL FUNCTIONS IN NUMBER THEORY BY MEANS OF GENERATING FUNCTIONS AND TO STUDY THE STRUCTURE OF FINITE FIELDS IN NUMBER THEORY.

THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMPLETE SET OF ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES NEITHER A COMPLETE COMPUTATIONAL ALGEBRAIC SYSTEM PER SI, BUT ONLY PROVIDES SOME SNIPPETS OF CODE TO HANDLE USEFUL ALGEBRAIC CONSTRUCTS LIKE POLYNOMIALS, MATRICES, DETERMINANTS AND SO FORTH. IT WILL BE UPDATED AS SOON AS NEEDED OR NEW INTERESTING MATERIAL IS FOUND.

ANY CONTRIBUTION OR SUGGESTION IS ENTIRELY WELLCOME.

# OBSERVATIONS: 
THIS REPOSITORY WAS CREATED MAINLY FOR LEARNING AND PEDAGOGICAL PURPOSES (I'M NOT A PROFESSIONAL MATHEMATICIAN) ONE SHOULD MAKE USE OF SOME ROBUST SYSTEM LIKE PARI-GP, SYMPY (PYTHON), NTL, LINALG, FLINT, ARMADILLO AND SO ON FOR SECURITY, CORRECTINESS OR PERFORMANCE CRITICAL APPLICATIONS. IN THESE (AND SOME OTHER) LIBRARIES THERE ARE VERY USEFUL FACILITIES TO HANDLE ALGEBRAIC CONSTRUCTS. FOR DIFFERENT APPLICATIONS THERE MAY BE DIFFERENT SPECIFICATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN NUMBER THEORY IN MODERN FACTORING OR DISCRETE LOGARITHM SUB-EXPONENTIAL ALGORITHMS ONE HAS TO HANDLE SPARSE MATRICES (WITH MANY ENTRIES ZERO), SOME ALGEBRAIC PROBLEMS LIKE SOLVING CERTAIN CLASSES OF LINEAR SYSTEMS MAY REQUIRE TO HANDLE DENSE MATRICES (MOSTLY WITH NON-ZERO ENTRIES). THERE ARE DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS SUITABLE FOR EACH CLASS OF MATRICES. IN MANY CASES LIBRARIES ARE OPTIMIZED FOR A SPECIFIC CLASS OF PROBLEMS.
